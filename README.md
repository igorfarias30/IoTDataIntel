Predicting the temperature in a sensor. The only goal is to create a machine learning model that predict a temperature in a sensor. We have to use Linear Regression to predict values.

There are 54 sensors and each sensor are mapping in a specific coordinates. You can see more details [here](http://db.csail.mit.edu/labdata/labdata.html).

## _Linear Regression_

```math
$y_{i} = {ax_{i} + b}$
```
$$y_{i} = {ax_{i} + b}.$$
