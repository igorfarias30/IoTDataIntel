Predicting the temperature in a sensor. The only goal is to create a machine learning model that predict a temperature in a sensor. We have to use Linear Regression to predict values.

There are 54 sensors and each sensor are mapping in a specific coordinates.

## _Linear Regression_
$$y_{i} = {ax_{i} + b}.$$
